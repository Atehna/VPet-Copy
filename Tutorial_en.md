### Data Calculation

When turned on, the needs system for your Virtual Pet becomes active, causing thirst, hunger, and mood to decrease over time. If you'd rather skip this part of gameplay, simply keep data calculation off.

### Calculation Interval

Calculates status change of your Virtual Pet. The longer the interval, the less frequent your Virtual Pet needs attention, and the slower her needs decay. Conversely, the shorter the interval, the faster her needs decay. You can adjust this to your preference.

* If you only want to feed your Virtual Pet occasionally, a longer calculation interval is better.
* If you want your Virtual Pet to level up faster, a shorter calculation interval is better.

### Interaction Cycles

Affects how many data calculation cycles are allowed to pass before your Virtual Pet decides to move around. The larger the number, the less frequent your Virtual Pet moves.

#### Smart Moving
